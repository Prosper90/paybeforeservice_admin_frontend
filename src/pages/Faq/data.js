    { question: 'What is Escrow?', answer: `An escrow-style platform refers to a payment system in which a neutral third party safeguards funds or assets until specific conditions are satisfied between two parties.\nFor instance, let's say you're purchasing a car (or any digital service or item) from an online seller. In such a scenario, you can utilize an escrow-style platform, such as ours, to guarantee the secure holding of your payment until the car is delivered to you. Upon receiving the vehicle, you have a 24-hour window to inspect it and report any issues through our complaint process. Once this complaint period expires, the escrow platform releases the payment to the seller.\nThis approach ensures protection for both the buyer and the seller, as it ensures that the payment is only released when the mutually agreed-upon conditions have been fulfilled. It serves as a safeguard against scams, fraudulent activities, and disputes that may arise among the involved parties.` },
